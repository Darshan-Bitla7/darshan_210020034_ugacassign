General- To add, edit or delete any student data, one must login to the system first otherwise it is view-only for guest visitors.
         To create a superuser run the command '-python3 manage.py createsuperuser' in the project terminal and then with the login credentials thus 
         generated you can login to the page and manipulate the database.
         
Database population- To feed data into the database,(only when you run it the first time) run the command in your project terminal 
                    -'python3 manage.py loaddata student_data.json'. This will load the json data from 'student_data.json' into the django models
